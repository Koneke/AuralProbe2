Aural Probe Source Code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for downloading Aural Probe and taking a closer look at the source 
code. If you have any improvements, by all means please make them and let me
know. Otherwise have fun poking around.

To run under VS2010, set the Aural Probe project debug working directory to
"../../..".

Developed with FMOD Ex Programmer API 4.44.20 and NSIS 3.01a.

Also allow me to do the typical programmer disclaimer: This code has been
(barely) maintained for 7+ years. It was originally written a long time ago,
fairly hastily, and on reflection it's rather messy, ignores some Windows
programming conventions, and is rather fragile. I'd do it differently if I
started again. But it works, so that's good.

If you'd like to get in touch with me with questions/suggestions, you can do 
so at a1studmuffin@gmail.com.
	
Thanks for your interest!
