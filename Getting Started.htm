<h4>Tutorial</h4>
<p>This section explains how to get started quickly with Aural Probe.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you launch Aural Probe for the first time, you must configure your search folders. These are the folders it will search for audio files (aka. samples). Searching and indexing is read-only - Aural Probe will never modify your samples.</li>
<li>From the main window, click "Config..." to bring up the Configuration dialog.</li>
<li>Under "Search Folders", type one or more local or network folder paths, one per line, for example:
<pre>C:\Samples<br/>E:\DrumSamples<br/>\\music\samples</pre></li>
<li>Under "Categories", click on the "Claps" category to see the Search Criteria. This means any samples found with "clap", "clp" or "cp" in their file name will be added to the "Claps" category. Samples can exist in multiple categories.
<li>Click OK to save your changes and return to the main window.</li>
<li>You will be prompted to scan all search folders for audio samples. Click Yes. This operation may take several minutes depending on how large your sample collection is. You can rescan your search folders at any time by clicking "Rescan" from the main window, which is necessary when you add new search folders, or add new samples to your collection.</li>
<li>Once complete, the status bar will tell you how many samples were found. Click on the "All Samples" category on the left to see them all.</li>
<li>Use the mouse or cursor keys to scroll through the samples. Samples will playback automatically as you select them.</li>
<li>Click on another category such as "Kicks". The number in brackets indicates how many samples are in this category.</li>
<li>Click and drag any sample out of the Aural Probe window into an Explorer window, or another application such as a sequencer. You can drag and drop samples into any compatible program. You can select more than one sample at a time by holding Shift or Ctrl while clicking samples.</li>
<li>Right-click one or more samples to bring up a pop-up menu. You can jump to the files in explorer, copy the samples to the clipboard, copy the samples as a path to the clipboard, mark samples as favorites, or delete the samples from your computer.</li>
<li>Mark some samples as favorites by pressing Space. Now toggle the "Favorites" button in the top menu. Now only the samples you have marked as favorites are shown. Toggle the "Favorites" button again to show all samples.</li>
<li>Click "Save..." to bring up the save dialog. You can now save the favorites you've just marked, which can be loaded again later at any time. Getting comfortable with multiple favorite collections is an important part of getting the most from Aural Probe.</li>
